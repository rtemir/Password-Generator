# Password-Generator

Instructions

To create a password generator that takes user inputs to create a randomized string of characters.

Purpose

Having strong and secure passwords is important for everyone in order to keep their data and privacy safe.

Directions

The password must be 8-128 characters long.

Also, the user must choose at least one of the following:

Special Characters Numeric Characters Lowercase Characters Uppercase Characters

Once generated, the user can click on the clipboard icon to copy the password to their clipboard.

Issues

When only 'symbols' is selected the alert "please choose at least one character type" is popping up, though the password still renders. I just couldn't figure out how to stop that alert from popping in that scenario.
